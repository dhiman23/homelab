# homelab
Homelab from scratch ‚Äî fully containerized, automated, and self-managed.  This project is a ground-up homelab setup featuring K3s, CI/CD, monitoring, GitOps, and secure networking. Every service is deployed and managed via code, enabling reproducibility, scalability, and complete control.

# üè† Homelab Setup ‚Äì From Scratch

This project documents the creation of a fully automated, self-hosted homelab using **Kubernetes (K3s)**, **CI/CD tools**, **AI workloads**, and **automation** using **Terraform** and **Ansible**. The homelab will run production-grade workloads and support monitoring, logging, and security best practices.

## üß† **Project Goals**

- **Full Automation**: Provision infrastructure and manage services with **Terraform** and **Ansible**.
- **Kubernetes-based Setup**: Use **K3s** to deploy containerized workloads.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automate deployment pipelines with **Jenkins**, **Trivy**, **OWASP ZAP**, and **SBOM** generation.
- **AI/ML Workloads**: Run **Kubeflow** to orchestrate AI/ML workflows, including training, model serving, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Set up **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Loki** for monitoring and centralized logging.
- **Secure Networking**: Use **Tailscale** or **WireGuard** for secure VPN access and enforce network security policies.

## üöÄ **Setup and Installation Guide**

### **1. Hardware & Virtualization Layer**

1. **Choose Hardware**:
   - Old laptops, desktop systems, or dedicated servers.
   - Consider resource-heavy components for **AI/ML workloads** (at least 8GB RAM, 4 cores, and optional GPU support).

2. **Install Virtualization Platform**:
   - **Proxmox** or **VMware ESXi** for virtualization.
   - **VirtualBox** for testing or smaller setups.

3. **Set Static IP**:
   - Assign static IP for consistency in your homelab's networking.
   - SSH access setup for remote management.

---

### **2. Kubernetes Setup (K3s)**

1. **Install K3s** (Lightweight Kubernetes):
   - Install K3s on your base machine to host containerized workloads.
   - This includes installing MetalLB for LoadBalancer services and configuring persistent storage.

2. **Deploy Ingress Controller**:
   - Set up **NGINX Ingress** to route external traffic into the cluster.

3. **Persistent Storage**:
   - Use **Longhorn** or **OpenEBS** to provide dynamic storage provisioning in Kubernetes.

4. **Cluster Networking**:
   - MetalLB will allocate external IP addresses to services, which are required for hosting services outside of the cluster.

---

### **3. Automation Setup (Terraform + Ansible)**

1. **Provision Infrastructure**:
   - Use **Terraform** to provision VMs, networking, and storage (if deploying in a cloud or larger-scale virtualized environment).
   - **Ansible** to configure servers, K3s, Docker, security settings, and other services.

2. **Create Infrastructure-as-Code**:
   - Terraform files to set up infrastructure
   - Ansible playbooks for server configurations and software installations

---

### **4. CI/CD Setup (Jenkins + Security)**

1. **Install Jenkins**:
   - Set up Jenkins in the K3s cluster to automate your build and deployment pipelines.
   - Integrate Jenkins with GitHub/GitLab to trigger builds and deployments.

2. **Image Scanning**:
   - Integrate **Trivy** to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
   - Use **OWASP ZAP** for dynamic application security testing (DAST).

3. **SBOM Generation**:
   - Use **Syft** to generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for transparency and security.

---

### **5. AI/ML Workloads (Kubeflow)**

1. **Install Kubeflow**:
   - Install Kubeflow on the K3s cluster to orchestrate AI/ML workflows.
   - Kubeflow provides Jupyter Notebooks, Pipelines, Katib (for hyperparameter tuning), and KFServing (for model serving).

2. **Configure Kubeflow Pipelines**:
   - Set up ML workflows, including training, validation, and deployment pipelines.

3. **Run AI Workloads**:
   - Deploy AI/ML models using **KFServing** and track training with **Katib**.

---

### **6. Monitoring & Logging**

1. **Prometheus for Monitoring**:
   - Set up **Prometheus** to scrape and monitor metrics from your K3s cluster and services.
   
2. **Grafana for Visualization**:
   - Use **Grafana** to visualize metrics from Prometheus in customized dashboards.
   
3. **Loki for Logging**:
   - Set up **Loki** for centralized logging in your cluster to collect logs from containers, services, and infrastructure.

---

### **7. Networking & Access Control**

1. **VPN Setup**:
   - Set up **Tailscale** or **WireGuard** to secure remote access to your homelab.
   
2. **DNS and Pi-hole**:
   - Configure **Pi-hole** to handle internal DNS and ad-blocking.
   - Optionally use **MetalLB** to allocate external IPs and expose services.

---

### **8. Backup & Recovery**

1. **Automated Backups**:
   - Use **Velero** or **Restic** to back up Kubernetes resources and volumes.
   
2. **Disaster Recovery**:
   - Test the backup and recovery process to ensure data resilience.

---

### **9. Security & Access Control**

1. **Firewall & Network Policies**:
   - Implement firewall rules and **Network Policies** in Kubernetes for service isolation and traffic control.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Set up **RBAC** in Kubernetes to limit access to sensitive resources and ensure secure operations.
